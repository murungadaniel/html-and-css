# HTML & CSS Journey 

Iâ€™m learning HTML and CSS from scratch over 5 months (July to December 2025). This repo tracks my daily practice, notes, and mini-projects.

## Goals
- Learn core HTML elements
- Understand CSS styling and layouts
- Build responsive webpages

## Structure
- Each month is a folder (`month-01`, etc.)
- Weekly folders (`week-01`) contain daily files and notes

## Start Date
July 25, 2025
